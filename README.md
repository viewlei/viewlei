- 👋 Hi, I’m @viewlei, living in ShangHai.
- 👀 I’m interested in audio understanding and interaction.
- 🌱 I'm exploring how to apply speech language models(SLM) in the next generation of faster and smarter voice interaction systems (like GPT-4o😄).
- 🎵 I have experience in natural language understanding(NLU) and speech recognition(ASR), with familiarity in the transformer architecture model.
